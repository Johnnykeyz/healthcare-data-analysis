## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
- Load CSV data into Pandas DataFrame
- Check data types, missing values, basic statistics
- Preview data structure

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Convert date columns to datetime format
- Create derived features (age groups, month)
- Encode categorical variables for analysis

### 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total patients treated
- Average length of stay
- Average treatment cost
- Treatment success rate
- Readmission rate

### 4. Segmented Analysis
- **By Condition:** Success rates, costs, stay duration
- **By Treatment Type:** Effectiveness comparison
- **By Age Group:** Cost and outcome patterns
- **By Insurance:** Cost distribution analysis

### 5. Trend Analysis
- Monthly admission patterns
- Cost trends over time
- Seasonal variations

### 6. Statistical Correlations
- Age vs. cost relationship
- Length of stay vs. cost
- Doctor visits vs. outcomes

### 7. Business Insights
- High-cost case identification
- Optimization opportunities
- Best practice recommendations
